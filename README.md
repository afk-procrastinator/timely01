A leightweight Discord bot written with Discord.py and using the Arrow timezone library in order to organize user timezones and other time - based activities. 
I am always looking for support and feedback, so feel free to fork or message me on Discord at Spencer#3762.
This bot is perfect for small to mid-sized servers with a large international following, or want helpful and fun utilities such as a currency converter, timer, API access, birthday checks, and message statistics!

## Goals and features:
- Time zone converter 
- Currency converter
- Timer and reminders
- Check current time for a user
- Message statistics
- Days/weeks/years until a certain date
- Global heatmap **[not yet implemented]**
- IMDB and HLTB data
- Birthday storage and checking
- Birthday reminders **[not yet implemented]**
